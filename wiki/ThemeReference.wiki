This document explains all the options that are available for creating custom themes.

= File structure =

Same folder where iRTVO.exe is located is theme-folder. This folder contains one or more folders which are named after the theme they contain. These folders have settings.ini which describes the theme and multiple png-files to show the wanted graphics. Additionally folder can contain custom fonts (ttf-files) for the theme.

== Example file structure ==

{{{
iRTVO.exe
iWrapClient.dll
themes\FIA Style\settings.ini
themes\FIA Style\driver.png
themes\FIA Style\laptime.png
themes\FIA Style\results.png
...
themes\FIA Style\DejaVuSans.ttf
themes\FIA Style\DejaVuSansMono.ttf
themes\Nascar Style\settings.ini
...
}}}

= settings.ini =

Settings.ini is the only required file for theme to function. Settings.ini describes how and what the program should draw text on the overlay. 

The file is a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file regular ini-file] consisting of sections which are marked as `[SectionName]`. Each section contains key-value pairs `someproperty=something`.

== Minimum settings.ini ==

In settings.ini there are a few mandatory fields. All these locate under General section and are shown below.

{{{
[General]
name=Theme name
author=Me
width=1280
height=720
}}}

* `name` should be the same as the folder where settings.ini is located. For example `themes/Awesome Theme/settings.ini` must have Awesome Theme as it's name.
* `author` it's your name
* `width` width of the graphics files used
* `height` height of the graphics files used
