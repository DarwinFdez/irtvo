|| number || Number of items to draw || 10 || Applies only to overlays that have dataset as `standing` ||
|| offset|| Skip a number of drivers from the top || 10 || Applies only to overlays that have dataset as `standing` ||


== Overlay labels ==

Each of the labels defined in overlay's labels must be defined in its own section. For example {{{labels=name,diff}}} in {{{[Overlay-driver]}}} must then have {{{[Overlay-driver-name]}}} and {{{[Overlay-driver-diff]}}}.

|| *Name* || *Description* || *Example value* || *Note* ||
|| *width* || Object's width in pixels || 400 ||  ||
|| *fontsize* || Font size for the text || 34 ||  ||
|| *text* || Text formatting || {position_ord} || See [ThemeReference#text] ||
|| font || Font used to draw the text || Arial || Can be filename or a font name installed in Windows ^1^ ||
|| fontcolor || Font color for the text || black || [http://samples.msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/samples/author/dhtml/colors/ColorTable.htm See all possible colors] ||
|| fontbold || Font weight for the text || false || true or false ||
|| fontitalic || Font style for the text || `true` or `false` || ||
|| align || Text alignment inside its borders || left || `left`, `right` or `center` ||
|| left || Top-left corner's distance from parent object's left border || 0 || ||
|| top || Top-left corner's distance from parent object's top border || 0 || ||
|| offset || Add offset to shown driver. || -1 || ^2^ ||

^1^ When using filename the file must be on the theme folder. When using just a font name, the font must be installed in Windows' font folder. Valid values are either `arial.ttf` (filename) or `Arial` (installed)

^2^ For example `dataset=followed` and the driver followed is on 3rd place. The using `offset=-1` would show data of the driver on 2nd place and similarly `offset=3` would show data of 5th place driver.

=== Text ===

Text property select what information is shown on the overlay. Different datasets have different data available.

= Tickers =

Each of the tickers defined in General-section must have corresponding {{{Ticker-tickername}}}-section. For example if {{{tickers=standings}}} then there must be {{{[Ticker-standings]}}}.

Tickers have the same properties as overlays. See [ThemeReference#Overlays]. There are few additional fields:

|| *Value* || *Description* || *Example output* || * Note* ||
|| fillvertical || Sets the direction which labels are stacked. When `true` it creates multi row ticker. `false` is the normal behavior. || false || Valid values are `true` or `false` ||

= Buttons =

Each of the buttons defined in General-section must have corresponding {{{Button-buttonname}}}-section. For example if {{{buttons=sidepanel,ticker}}} then there must be {{{[Button-sidepanel]}}} and {{{[Button-ticker]}}}.

Buttons show and hide overlays, images and tickers. Each button can do any combination of these.

|| *Value* || *Description* || *Example output* || * Note* ||

= Videos =

Each of the videos defined in General-section must have corresponding {{{Video-videoname}}}-section. For example if {{{videos=replay}}} then there must be {{{[Video-replay]}}}.

|| *Value* || *Description* || *Example output* || * Note* ||

|| *zIndex* || Stacking order of all items in the theme || 10 || Item with largest zIndex will be shown top most and vice versa ||
|| flag || sets image visible when selected flag is set || green || Valid values are `green`, `yellow`, `white` and `checkered` ||
|| light || sets image visible when selected start light is set || green || Valid values are `green`, `red` and `off` ||
|| replay || sets image visible when replay is rewindign || true || ||

= External Data =

External data is stored in a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values CSV-file] called data.csv which is located at the theme folder. This file is semicolon separated table where first column is the driver's customer id.

== Example file ==
{{{
35698;Finland;Oulu;Team Trellet
12345;USA;Boston;Team USA
}}}

Now `{external:0}` would become `Finland` or `USA` and `{external:2}` `Team Trellet` or `Team USA` respectively. 

If the CSV file doesn't have row for the selected driver the external fields will be ignored.

*Tip:* You can use almost any spreadsheet program to create csv-files, including Google Docs.

= cars.ini =

cars.ini holds the names of cars and classes. File can be in same folder as the irtvo.exe or on theme folder.

Format is {{{carname="Car name"}}}. `carname` is the same used in setup folders, but spaces are replaced with backslashes "\". For example:

{{{
[Cars]
c6r="Corvette C6R"
radical\sr8="Radical SR8"

[Multiclass]
c6r="GT1"
radical\sr8="Prototype"
}}}

= tracks.ini =

tracks.ini holds the names of tracks. File can be in same folder as the irtvo.exe or on theme folder.

Format is {{{track="Track name"}}}. `track` is the same used in `camera.ini` in `Documents\iRacing`. For example:

{{{
[Tracks]
Sonoma\long=Infineon long
}}}
